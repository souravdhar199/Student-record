# Student-record
This program will calculate grade based on students midterm and final grade  and it will save all the data in a file.  

The language that I used in this program is Java. This program will take students name, their id and, their midterm and final grade as input 
and then it will calculate the average test grade and then it will decide the GPA. For example if the average test grade is more then 90 
it will say Gpa 4.0, if the grade is more the 80 but less then 90 it will set the GPA 3.0 etc. And lastly it will create a file and save 
all the data in there. 

For clear understanding of this program, I added a video on this project you can downlaod this and watch it, It ill show the output of this program.(File name: Recording #3.mp4)
